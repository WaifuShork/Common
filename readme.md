# WaifuShork's Common Code
(inspired by [Emzi's Common Code](https://github.com/Emzi0767/Common)) 

After reading through DSharpPlus source code and seeing they referenced a project called `Emzi0767.Common`, 
I decided to create my own collection of common reusable components that I use in most of my projects.

## Requirements
This library is built specifically for [.NET 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dotnet-five),
It's not that I don't want to support other frameworks, it's just that with the release of [.NET 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dotnet-five),
I believe that all projects should be migrated to the latest and greatest (if possible). I also almost never 
actually work with older frameworks because I do my best to actively avoid it.

## Nuget
As of right now since the repository is very new and empty, I don't plan on adding it nuget any time soon 
unfortunately.

## Documentation
Coming soonâ„¢
